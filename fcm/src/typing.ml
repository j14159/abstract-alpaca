  [1] 1ML â€“ Core and Modules United (F-ing First-Class Modules)
      https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/1ml-jfp-draft.pdf

  Something like this needs to work, tested in the 1ML interpreter:

  X b (c : b) (Y : { type t; init : t }) (x : int) = { v = Y.init; type u = Y.t; bb = c ; xx = x};
  X (Y : { type t; init : t }) (b : type) (c : b) = { v = Y.init; type u = Y.t; bb = c };

  In both cases these are "just functions" that create modules.  For Alpaca, I'd
  like to be able to refer directly to `t` in the function body, rather than
  `Y.t`.

  Type `t` is a universal:
    G (x : { type t; init : t }) = x.init

    X = { type t = int; init = 0 }
    G X; -- should be `int`.

    -- Sealed with an abstract, existential type introduction:
    Y = { type t = int; init = 0; zero = 0 } :> { type t; init : t }
    G Y; -- should be exi[_]
*)
open Core

(* Raised when substitution of large types for small is attempted.
   E.g. when a signature/module is provided in place of a type variable.

exception Predicativity_violation of pos

(** Modules (structures) are typed as rows that are not extensible.

    More specifically:  an open (extensible) row can only be used as an argument
    to a function (functor).  This exception is thrown if an "open" module makes
    it to the typer.
